# StraightLinePrograms

This library supports the use of an algebraic data structure known as straight line programs (SLPs). An SLP can be used to represent a computation path of an algebraic expression. The library currently supports basic polynomial, vector, and matrix algebraic manipulations.
Additionally, this library has a fully functioning automatic differentiation system for the currently supported operations and objects.
